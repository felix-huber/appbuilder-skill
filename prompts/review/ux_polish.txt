I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application
workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal
or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved
from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our
UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing,
and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.

Consider both desktop UI/UX and mobile UI/UX separately while doing this
and hyper-optimize for both separately to play to the specifics of each modality.

Check for:
1. Visual hierarchy and spacing
2. Color consistency and contrast
3. Typography and readability
4. Loading states and transitions
5. Error messages and feedback
6. Empty states
7. Micro-interactions
8. Touch targets (mobile)
9. Keyboard navigation (desktop)
10. Accessibility (WCAG compliance)

I'm looking for true world-class visual appeal, polish, slickness, etc.
that makes people gasp at how stunning and perfect it is in every way.

Use ultrathink.

After review, report:
- Issues found (categorized by severity)
- Specific improvements made
- If no improvements needed, say "UI/UX polish complete - looks world-class"
