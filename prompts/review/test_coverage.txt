Do we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff?
What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed
logging?

## TDD Verification
First, check if tests were written FIRST (per TDD):
- Are there test files alongside implementation files?
- Do the tests match the specs from the bead description?
- Are unit test specs from beads actually implemented?

## Coverage Check
1. Unit tests for all functions/methods (TDD - written first)
2. Integration tests for API endpoints (separate beads)
3. E2E tests for user flows (separate beads)
4. Edge case coverage
5. Error path coverage
6. Test quality (not just coverage %)

For each gap found:
- Describe what's missing
- Explain why it's important
- Prioritize by risk

If coverage is incomplete, create a comprehensive and granular set of
beads (or tasks) for all missing tests with:
- Tasks and subtasks
- Dependency structure
- Detailed comments on what to test and how

Use ultrathink.

After analysis, report:
- Current coverage assessment
- TDD compliance (were tests written first?)
- Gaps identified (categorized)
- New test beads/tasks created (if any)
- If coverage is complete, say "Test coverage verified - comprehensive"
