Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you
just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes"
looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues,
confusion, etc.

Carefully fix anything you uncover. Use ultrathink.

**FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT CHECK:**
Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.
- Are there unnecessary abstractions?
- Could this be done with fewer lines?
- Is there accidental complexity that could be removed?
- Are there simpler standard library methods that could replace custom code?

Specific checks:
1. Does the code do what the bead/task description says?
2. Are there any logical errors?
3. Is error handling complete?
4. Are edge cases covered?
5. Is the code readable and maintainable?
6. Are there any security issues?
7. Is performance acceptable?
8. **UNIT TESTS**: Do tests exist and cover the new code?
   - Happy path (normal operation)
   - Edge cases (boundaries, empty inputs)
   - Error paths (invalid inputs, exceptions)
   - If NO tests exist for new feature code, CREATE THEM NOW
   - (Setup/chore tasks may not need unit tests)

After review, report:
- Issues found and fixed
- Simplifications made (if any)
- Any remaining concerns
- If no issues found, say "Fresh eyes review complete - code looks good"

Keep running this review until no more issues are found!
