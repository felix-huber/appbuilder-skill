Reread AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md) so it's still fresh in your mind.

Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense?
Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better
for users? If so, revise the beads.

It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start
implementing these things!

DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY THINGS! DO NOT LOSE ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY!

## TDD Verification (Critical!)
For each FEATURE bead, verify:
- Does it have UNIT TEST SPECS section listing specific tests to write first?
- Are the test cases specific enough to guide implementation?
- Do they cover happy path, edge cases, and error handling?

For INTEGRATION/E2E test beads:
- Do they have proper dependencies on the feature beads they test?
- Are the scenarios clearly defined?

If a feature bead is missing unit test specs, ADD THEM NOW.

Also, make sure that we have dedicated beads for:
- Integration tests (test module interactions)
- E2E test scripts (test full user flows)

All test beads should have great, detailed logging so we can
be sure that everything is working perfectly after implementation.

Remember to ONLY use the `br` tool to create and modify the beads and
to add the dependencies to beads. Use ultrathink.

After review, state:
- How many beads were modified
- What changes were made
- Whether you found any issues that need addressing
- If no changes needed, say "Beads are stable - no changes made"
