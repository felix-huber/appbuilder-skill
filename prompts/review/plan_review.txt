Review the session plan in tasks/todo.md with fresh eyes.

Check for:

1. **Completeness**
   - Are all steps necessary to achieve the goal listed?
   - Are there implicit steps that should be explicit?
   - Is the verification strategy clear?

2. **Clarity**
   - Would another engineer understand what each step means?
   - Are there ambiguous terms that need definition?
   - Is the scope well-bounded?

3. **Ordering**
   - Are dependencies between steps correct?
   - Could any steps be parallelized?
   - Is the critical path identified?

4. **Risk**
   - What could go wrong at each step?
   - Are there fallback plans for risky steps?
   - Are there integration points that need extra attention?

5. **Verification**
   - How will we know each step is complete?
   - What tests or checks prove success?
   - Is "done" clearly defined?

For each issue found:
- Describe the problem
- Suggest a specific fix
- Apply the fix to tasks/todo.md

Continue until no more issues are found.
