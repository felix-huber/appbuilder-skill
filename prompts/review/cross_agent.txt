Ok can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by
your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems,
inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully
diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis
and then fix or revise them if necessary?

Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go
super deep! Use ultrathink.

Review checklist:
1. Does the code match the bead specification?
2. Is the implementation approach sound?
3. Are there architectural issues?
4. Security vulnerabilities?
5. Performance problems?
6. Missing error handling?
7. Code style consistency?
8. Documentation completeness?

For each issue:
- Identify the root cause (not just symptoms)
- Propose a fix
- Assess impact if unfixed

After review, report:
- Code reviewed (files, commits, beads)
- Issues found (with severity)
- Fixes applied
- Recommendations for original author
- If no issues found, say "Cross-agent review complete - code is solid"
