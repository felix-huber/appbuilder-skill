I want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project,
choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their
functionality and execution flows through the related code files which
they import or which they are imported by.

Once you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of
the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical
check with "fresh eyes" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues,
silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and
intelligently correct them.

Be sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md) and ensure
that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides
referenced there. Use ultrathink.

Focus areas:
1. Off-by-one errors
2. Null/undefined handling
3. Race conditions
4. Resource leaks
5. Error handling gaps
6. Edge cases
7. Type mismatches
8. Logic errors

After exploration, report:
- Files explored
- Bugs found (with file:line references)
- Fixes applied
- If no bugs found, say "Bug hunt complete - no issues found"
